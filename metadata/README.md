### Data Organization and IDs

Each structure is uniquely identified by a Materials Project (mp) ID.

Each ground-truth SCF run is assigned a unique UUID. These UUIDs are used to build the directory structure of in `data`, e.g.:
```
$ tree -L 3 data | head -n 4
data
├── 00
│   ├── 02
│   │   └── bbce-ad7f-4271-bf87-3181a62e9ef0
```

These directories contain all metadata and most data generated by the DFT code (wavefunctions are excluded due to large disk space usage).

The map of mp IDs to SCF UUIDs is given in `metadata/scf.txt`


### Generating splits

For an initial set of structures we use the set used in OCP's OC20 dataset
* https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/opencatalystproject/data/input_generation/mapping_bulks_2021sep20.txt

This set of structures comes from the Materials Project.

Structure geometry was downloaded from the Materials Project API.

We include this data in `init-structures` for completeness.

This info was then used to filter and select structures to generate the train/test/val splits used in this project. See `create_splits.py` for more info.
